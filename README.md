# File-Transfer-Protocol---Systems-Programming-Final-Project

This is a low-level FTP program I designed in C that can handle file transfers between a networked client and remote server.

This is my personal project for a College level course, I strictly prohibit any copying or modification of my code out of respect for the instructor and the academic integrity of the institution
